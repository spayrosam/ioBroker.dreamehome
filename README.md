**0.0.8**

New Features Added:
- Voice Commands Accepted with Alexa Adapter:
    Please note that voice commands will be accepted only if the Alexa adapter is installed and properly configured.
- Voice Commands for Room Cleaning:
    Users can now use voice commands like "Vacuum," "Mop," "Vacuum and Mop," and "Mop after Vacuum" to customize the cleaning process. Voice commands for repetitions (e.g., "clean three times") are also supported.
- Mode Management for Different Cleaning Types:
    A new mechanism has been implemented to distinguish between various cleaning modes:
        . Vacuum and Mop, Mop, Vacuum, Mop after Vacuum
- Automatic Activation of CleanGenius:
    If no specific cleaning mode is mentioned, the CleanGenius mode will be automatically set to true; otherwise, it will be set to false.
- Multiple Rooms with Different Settings:
    The adapter now supports cleaning multiple rooms with different cleaning modes. Users can specify different cleaning actions for each room.
- Enhanced Voice Command Processing:    The voice commands for room cleaning have been improved to correctly recognize combinations such as "Vacuum in the living room and mop in the bathroom."
- Optimized Room Assignment:
    The assignment of cleaning modes and repetitions to multiple rooms has been optimized to allow for more precise execution.

  **Example Voice Commands:**
    1. "Vacuum the living room"
   
    *Expected Outcome: The robot will start vacuuming the living room using the Vacuum mode (Mode 5122).*
   
    2. "Mop the kitchen"
   
    *Expected Outcome: The robot will start mopping the kitchen using the Mop mode (Mode 5121).*
   
    3. "Vacuum and mop the bedroom"
   
    *Expected Outcome: The robot will first vacuum the bedroom and then mop it using Vacuum and Mop mode (Mode 5120).*
   
    4. "Mop after vacuum in the hallway"
   
    *Expected Outcome: The robot will first vacuum the hallway and then mop it using the Mop after Vacuum mode (Mode 5123).*
    
    5. "Clean the bathroom three times"
   
    *Expected Outcome: The robot will clean the bathroom using the default cleaning mode (either Vacuum or Mop, depending on the command) and repeat it 3 times.*
   
    6. "Clean the living room and the kitchen"
    
    *Expected Outcome: The robot will clean both the living room and the kitchen, each with the default cleaning mode. If no mode is specified, Vacuum and Mop mode (Mode 5120) will be applied by default.*

   **Beispiel-Sprachbefehle:**
    1. "Staubsauge das Wohnzimmer"
    
    *Erwartetes Ergebnis: Der Roboter beginnt, das Wohnzimmer mit dem Staubsaugmodus (Modus 5122) zu reinigen.*

    2. "Wische die K端che"
   
    *Erwartetes Ergebnis: Der Roboter beginnt, die K端che mit dem Wischmodus (Modus 5121) zu reinigen.*
   
    3. "Staubsaugen und Wischen im Schlafzimmer"
    
    *Erwartetes Ergebnis: Der Roboter wird zuerst das Schlafzimmer saugen und danach wischen, im Staubsaugen und Wischen Modus (Modus 5120).*
    
    4. "Wischen nach dem Saugen im Flur"
    
    *Erwartetes Ergebnis: Der Roboter wird zuerst den Flur saugen und danach wischen, im Wischen nach Saugen Modus (Modus 5123).*
   
    5. "Reinige das Badezimmer drei Mal"
    
    *Erwartetes Ergebnis: Der Roboter wird das Badezimmer mit dem Standard-Reinigungsmodus (entweder Staubsaugen oder Wischen, je nach Befehl) reinigen und dies 3 Mal wiederholen.*
    
    6. "Reinige das Wohnzimmer und die K端che"
    
    *Erwartetes Ergebnis: Der Roboter wird sowohl das Wohnzimmer als auch die K端che reinigen, wobei der Standard-Reinigungsmodus verwendet wird. Falls kein Modus angegeben ist, wird der Staubsaugen und Wischen Modus (Modus 5120) verwendet.*
